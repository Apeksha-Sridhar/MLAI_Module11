# MLAI_Module11

## Overview
This project is a Practical Assignment Module 11. Here I examine the different models to understand which car features is the best and worst predictors of its price. 

## Goal
The goal of this project is to help dealerships to fine tune their inventory for used cars depending on the price of the car.

## Dataset and Notebook

## Findings 

1. For selling used cars, based on the data, the most important features for the price of the car are year, fuel and type. Meanwhile, paint color and title_status are the least important features.
2. There is a U-shaped pattern of price with year. More specifically, car prices increase as the model goes from 1950-1960 and then decrease again as it goes to 1970. It again has a positive trend from 1980 onwards. In summary, cars between 1955-1965 and cars after 1990 have a higher sale value.
3. The pick ups and trucks sell for the highest price while minivans and hatchbacks sell for the lowest price.
4. Diesel cars sell for the greatest price, while hybrid used cars sell for the lowest price.
